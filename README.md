<b> WhatsApp like batch-chat with Username is typing.. support</b>
<br><font size=23>Update: Now with end-to-end encryption</font></br>
<br>- *Is there really end-to-end encyption?*</br>
<br>Ans: In so much as the server chat files are not stored in plain text,
<br>You need to understand end-to-end encryption on a batch scripting is a tall ask.
<br>While the chat (cipher text) could be decrypted by some one who knows / sees the key<br> or by brute
forcing it was never meant for security but rather for obsufcation. So that when<br> some one
opens the chat server file they are not immediately privy to the chats.</br>

<br>Please take it with a pinch of Salt.</br>
