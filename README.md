<br>- *Is there really end-to-end encyption?*</br>
<br>Ans: In so much as the server chat files are not stored in plain text,
<br>You need to understand end-to-end encryption on a batch scripting is a tall ask.
<br>While the chat (cipher text) could be decrypted by some one who knows / sees the key<br> or by brute
forcing it was never meant for security but rather for obsufcation. So that when<br> some one
opens the chat server file they are not immediately privy to the chats.</br>

A mechanism could be implemented for rotating / multiple / changing keys. A project called 'tokenism'<br>
generates keys. Key is implemented in key.bat. First line in key.bat is only for reference. Keys can<br>
be changed manually. Both users must have the same keys to communicate. Symbols can be incorporated in<br>
keys. Please avoid using the following:<b> |  & " ^ % ! 
<br>Please take it with a pinch of Salt.</br>
